SAP Logon password Encryptor/Decryptor

Prior to version 7.40 (inclusive), SAP Logon could save passwords in its shortcuts. See more https://blogs.sap.com/2016/10/31/save-password-sap-logon-shortcut/

The shortcut file is located at %APPDATA%\SAP\Common\sapshortcut.ini 

Passwords in this file are encoded. This program allows you to decode them, as well as receive a password in encoded form according to the same algorithm.

Download latest release [here](https://github.com/alezhu/sap_logon_password_codec/releases/latest). You can download WTL- or Qt- version
